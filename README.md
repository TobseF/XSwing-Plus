# ðŸŽ® XSwing Plus

> Open Source remake of a classic match 3 arcade game.

### Trivia
The original game was named [Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(video_game)) (Marble Master)
and was developed by [Software 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_2000)
a German game developer and publisher. It was released in 1997 for PC, PlayStation and Game Boy Color.

My goal was to bring this masterpiece of arcade action back to life. I wanted to recreate the original
graphics and game mechanics as accurately as possible. The game is written in Java and runs
on Windows, Linux, Mac and Android.

### Licence
This remake is a free fan project. _Software 2000_ is not involved in any way.
The company _Software 2000_ filed for bankruptcy in 2002. But the _Swing_ brand, graphics and sounds
may still be licenced by others. I tried to contact someone from the original team to get permission
to use the original theme - but without success. Another clone of the game for Android and IOS was 
also available under the name _Color-X-Plode_.  
The code is licenced under [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

I started the development in 2007 - A time when _git_ took its first steps and version control wasn't 
the first thing to do. This repository was restored from zipped code backups between 2007 and 2013.
